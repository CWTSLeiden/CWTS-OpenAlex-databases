		database	OpenAlex is a free and open database of scholary papers, journals, researchers, and institutions along with all the ways they are connected. It is made by the nonprofit OurResearch. For more information, see https://openalex.org.<br><br>The CWTS version of the OpenAlex database is based on the OpenAlex snapshot in native format. Loading the snapshot directly into a relation database is not possible and therefore some transformations were needed to make. However, with the CWTS relational model of OpenAlex we tried to stay as close as possible to the native format of OpenAlex. In addition to this document, the documentation on the OpenAlex entities available at https://docs.openalex.org/api-entities/entities-overview should therefore provide a good description of the tables and columns in the CWTS version of the OpenAlex database.<br><br>License: CC0, https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0.
